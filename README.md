# Geo Location Matching Module

## Summary

This project provides tools for geo location matching and geocoding, enabling robust comparison and linkage of location-based data across disparate datasets.

### Geo Location

Geo location refers to the identification of the physical location of an object, such as a business or address, using geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), postal codes, and other location descriptors. Accurate geo location is essential for mapping, logistics, customer analytics, and spatial data science.

### Geocoding

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses or place names into geographic coordinates. This allows for spatial analysis, matching, and visualization of data points on a map. Reverse geocoding converts coordinates back into human-readable addresses.

### Module Features

- **Fuzzy Matching:** Match locations across datasets using postal codes, addresses, customer names, and latitude/longitude, even when data is incomplete or inconsistent.
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardize zip codes, addresses, and coordinates for reliable matching.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Supports matching on various combinations of location and descriptive fields.
- **Optimized Matching:** Combines exact and fuzzy logic for high-accuracy results.

This module is ideal for use cases such as customer deduplication, address validation, logistics optimization, and spatial data integration.
